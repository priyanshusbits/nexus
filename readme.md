Decentralized News Publication Platform
This is a decentralized news publication platform that operates on-chain and is censorship-resistant. The platform is built using Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, FVM, and Huddle01 SDK.

Problem
In today's world, traditional news publication platforms are centralized and often subject to censorship and editorial biases. This can lead to a lack of diversity in the news, and important stories may not receive the attention they deserve. In addition, these platforms are vulnerable to data breaches and other security issues.

The goal of this project is to create a decentralized, on-chain news publication platform that is immune to censorship, editorial biases, and security issues.

Tech Stack
Vanilla JS: A lightweight programming language for building the front-end of the platform.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style the platform.
FVM: A fast, lightweight virtual machine that executes smart contracts on the blockchain.
Huddle01 SDK: A software development kit for building decentralized applications on the Huddle01 blockchain.
